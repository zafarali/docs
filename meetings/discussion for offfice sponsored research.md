# What It Is

Briefly, HyveDev is a combination of smart home and personal computer.
Despite services like Nest being considerd the dawn of the "Smart Home," these devices aren't particularly smart.
Using predictive models of buildings should yield significant benefits, and HyveDev is targeting this along with CanmetENERGY, Sensorica, and Equipmind.
We also aim to use behavioural modification to encourage reduced costs in homes, such as encouraging a powerful central home computer that can be interfaced from terminals to reduce energy costs and standard water measurement to reduce water cost.

# The Project Plan


##  In the Next Six Months

1.  Work with collaborating companies on the Sensor Staccs project to build a set of open source sensors and actuators.
2.  Rig a room with Sensor Staccs humidity, temperature, pressure, etc. sensors and set up some building automation systems inside the room.  Possible testing sites include Loyola campus, which has a room we can use.
3.  Set up 4-6 students on undergraduate research projects to develop parts of the project while earning credit and getting a taste for research.

##  In the Next Year

1.  Sell prototypes of house statistics monitoring system to interest real estate agents and landlords.
2.  Generate automation

##  In the Further Future

Sell hardware to accompany a HyveDev platform that can be installed free of charge, excepting the hardware.
Provide more advanced analytics and services on a premium basis.
This could be tied to the Sensor Staccs program at first.

# Funding

HyveDev needs fairly little funding.
We should be able to sustain ourselves with small government grants or small contracts for prototype deployment.
Montreal Solar Decathlon Team will also be purchasing some of the equipment on which services are developed, since some or all of the product will be deployed with the Solar Decathlon Team House.

Should I avoid corporate funding as much as possible until absolutely necessary?
The current "startup culture" seems to glorify getting immediate funding, but I'd rather get a user base and several deployments of the system first.


# Partnerships

## Sensor Staccs Project

+  Equipmind and GlencrossBrunet, an energy concious small business started at McGill.  Creating an Internet of Things application for monitoring lab equipment use and applying behavioural modification to optimse usage, reducing energy costs.
+  Sensorica, a company in Montreal that builds sensory equipment on a contract basis.

## Building Automation Project using Sensor Staccs Equipment

+  CanmetENERGY, a part of Natural Resources Canada.  Leads programs in Buildings and Communities, Renewables, and Industrial Processes.
+  Equipmind and Sensorica.


# Incorporation

Should we incorporate?

This is a big question for me because I'm not sure what comes with being a corporation in Canada.
Will it be easier to get grants, should we go for government grants?
Would it be easier to work with other companies this way?

# Intellectual Property

A significant talking point, but a straightforward one.
