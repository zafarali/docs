# The Project Plan

##  In the Next Six Months

1.  Work with collaborating companies on the Sensor Staccs project to build a set of open source sensors and actuators.
2.  Rig a room with Sensor Staccs humidity, temperature, pressure, etc. sensors and set up some building automation systems inside the room.  Possible testing sites include Loyola campus, which has a room we can use.
3.  Set up 4-6 students on undergraduate research projects to develop parts of the project while earning credit and getting a taste for research.

##  In the Next Year

1.  Sell prototypes of house statistics monitoring system to interest real estate agents and landlords.
2.  Generate automation

##  In the Further Future

Sell hardware to accompany a HyveDev platform that can be installed free of charge, excepting the hardware.
Provide more advanced analytics and services on a premium basis.
This could be tied to the Sensor Staccs program at first.

# Funding

HyveDev needs fairly little funding.

# Partnerships

# Incorporation

Should we incorporate?

This is a big question for me because I'm not sure what comes with being a corporation in Canada.
Will it be easier to get grants, should we go for government grants?
Would it be easier to work with other companies this way?

# Intellectual Property

A significant talking point, but a straightforward one.
